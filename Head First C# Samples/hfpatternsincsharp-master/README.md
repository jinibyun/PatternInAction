Imported from https://hfpatternsincsharp.codeplex.com/
Original commit date: November 2010

Project Description
This project consists of ported code examples from the book Head First Design Patterns by Eric and Elizabeth Freeman into C#.

All example projects have been converted to use Visual Studio 2010 and target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile.

Head First Design Patterns - Code Examples in C# in currently in pre-alpha. Please view the Issue Tracker for a list of open issues.

Project Milestones
Alpha

    Convert the Composite and State example projects from Java to C#

Beta

    Add the Head First implementation of the Model-View-Controller pattern.

Production

    Confirm that all projects, especially the application harnesses, conform to the code in the book.
    Close all open work items.


The source is not verbatim from the book, rather it prefers C# syntax and data structures when applicable.
